// maybe add water tile, etc
enum TileState {
  INVALID, // invalid tile or terrain
  TERRAIN,

for tile in tiles:
  switch tile.state {
    case INVALID:
      break;
    case TERRAIN:
      break;
    case ENTITY_PLAYER:
      break;

**** maybe like this:

seems unecessary to scan through 100x100 tiles for an extremely low 
number of entities that are active

so:
go through each entity
to check if entity is standing on an item:
go through each item
and comapre the coordinates
  ** this opens up optimisation possibilities similar to grid-based collision systeom
  ** dont worry about this, the game will almost certainly run fine
problem: difficult to implement pathfinding/ai this way
must get CREATIVE to implement this

*** development challenges ***
  . procedural generation
  2. path finding
  3. audio
  4. entities
  5. items
  6. progression
  7. everything
***
  
*** notes ***
  only smart npcs are required to have smart ai
  consider not having player levels/progression (it probably should have it though...)
  main focus is items & moves?
  * the game is supposed to be difficult
  day/night cycle (mobs change)
  seasonal cycle (mobs and environment changes)
    - possibly affecting player & mobs stats
    - item changes/spawns
      - nullify certain item effects?
    - think of possible ways environment can affect ALL entities
    - LOTSA IDEAS!

*** you can actually do this (i think) ***
*** focus! ***
*** write many notes as they enter your mind!

*** game loop idea (limit scope):
  mystery dungeon roguelike
  main dungeon has like 100 floors (with checkpoints or something.. AND BOSSES)
  side dungeons for missions/training/items/etc? (dojo?)
  keep/lose items
  return home to sell/unlock stuff at shops etc
  some other dungeons for various things
  
  *focus on gameplay > story (more accessible for me to develop i guess)
  *on certain floors 'bosses' are present
